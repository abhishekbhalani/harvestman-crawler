# History of HarvestMan #
  1. Harvestman crawler was started by Anand B Pillai in June 2003 as a hobby project to develop a personal web crawler in Python, along with Nirmal Chidambaram.
  1. Nirmal writes the original code in mid June 2003(one module, single threaded crawler) which Anand improves substantially and develops into a multithreaded crawler.
  1. First version (0.8) was released by Anand in July 2003.
  1. Released on [freshmeat](http://www.freshmeat.net/projects/harvestman) (1.3) on Dec 2003

  1. Most recent release is 1.4.6, released on Sep 2005.
  1. Since early 2006, HarvestMan has been undergoing development along with the EIAO project (mostly with EIAO feedbacks), but no public releases have been done.

  1. Version 1.4.6 gets accepted into Debian in March 2006.
